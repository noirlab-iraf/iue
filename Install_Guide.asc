The following instructions will guide you through making your own personal 
installation of the `iuetools' package in IRAF.  Please note that these 
instructions apply to the current version (V1.1, 1999-Aug-9) of this package. 

PART 1:  First Time Set-Up
--------------------------

1)  If you have not already done so, retrieve the source tar file from the 
    NEWSIPS ftp area: ftp://ra.stsci.edu/pub/newsips/. Note that this 
    package depends upon recent versions of TABLES and IRAF.  If these 
    packages are not installed and configured on your system, you must do 
    so before proceeding with the rest of these instructions. 

2)  Untar the file in a suitable directory.  I will use the directory 
    "/home/shaw/iraf/source" and the tar file "iuetools.tar" for this example. 

	% cd /home/shaw/iraf/source
	% tar xvpf iuetools.tar

    Note that there are analogous, but not necessarily identical, commands for 
    this step if you are using a non-Unix operating system.  

3)  Edit the file "iuetools.cl" and change the line:

	string	iuetools	= "home$source/"

    to give the correct path to the directory with the executable, the ".par" 
    files, etc.  If you place the source code in a subdirectory of your IRAF 
    home directory (i.e., where your "login.cl" is found) and call it 
    "source", then the path: "home$source" would be correct, as in the 
    example above.  

4)  Compile the source code.  For this step, start an IRAF session and "cd" 
    to the directory where the source code was installed, then run "mkpkg".  
    Following the previous example, the steps would be:

	cl> cd source
	cl> mkpkg -p tables

    You will see a warning about the "iuetools.a" file not being found; 
    this is the normal behavior when the object file is first created. 
    After some time the compilation will yield a few new files, notably 
    "xx_iuetools.e" which is the executable.  If there were no errors, you 
    will be ready to use the "iuetools" package within IRAF after following 
    the directions in Part 2 below.


PART 2:  Using the Package
--------------------------

Here are the directions for loading and running the `iuetools' package once 
the package has been installed and rebuilt for your machine.  You will need 
to perform the first three steps each time you start a new IRAF session, 
unless you follow the advice in point 3:  

1)  Begin an IRAF session and load TABLES.  (Then "cd" to the directory 
    where the software is kept.  In fact, it would be best to define an 
    IRAF environment variable to point to that directory.)  Using the 
    example directory from 1) above: 

	cl> set iuetools = home$source/
	cl> cd iuetools$

    And don't forget the trailing slash (/) in the "iuetools" definition!

2)  Define the `iuetools' task, and load the package as:

	cl> task iuetools = iuetools$iuetools.cl
	cl> iuetools

3)  Now everything should work during this session.  I recommend that you put 
    the "iuetools$" environment variable and "iuetools" task definitions in 
    my "loginuser.cl" file so you don't have to define it each time at the 
    start of an IRAF session.   

4)  Since the "help" files aren't yet in the help database, you must 
    access them directly.  To get help on the task `mxexpand' for 
    example, do:

	cl> cd iuetools$doc
	cl> help mxexpand.hlp fi+

6)  For general information on the utilities in this package, read the 
    package help documentation. 

	cl> cd iuetools$
	cl> help iuetools.hlp fi+

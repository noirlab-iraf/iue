		     NEWSIPS/iuetools Release Notes
			Version 1.1, 1999-Aug-9

This release of the iuetools personal package offers two upgrades to 
existing tasks, and adds a third task.  Specifically the following 
tasks were changed:

mxexpand:
	A bug related to closing the output table files was corrected. 
	On some systems the task would complete normally, while on others
	the task would exit without producing output.  On still other 
	systems the task would die with a segmentation violation. 

mxtomultispec:
	This task used to be a CL script (in V1.0) that depended on certain 
	STSDAS and NOAO.onedspec tasks.  It has been re-written as a compiled 
	task, and no longer depends on STSDAS.  This task can also process 
	multiple input files, using the IRAF image template syntax.  The task 
	parameters have changed, so prior users will need to "unlearn" this 
	task before running the new version. 

A new task has been added:

infoiue
	This task will print a summary of the exposure information in a list 
	of one or more IUE data file headers.  (The information is retrieved 
	from the PHU of the FITS file.)  This task is intended to provide a  
	succinct  summary  of  the  most important  exposure  information in 
	an easily readible format. See the help document for details.
